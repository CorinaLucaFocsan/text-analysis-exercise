# Text Analysis Program

Program that parses text from a text file in Java.

## Summary

Program that analyzes the frequency of [verbal tics](http://www.newser.com/story/131668/speech-habits-of-psychopaths-analyzed-in-study.html) in historical recorded speech.

The program opens any text file specified by the user, and analyzes the frequency of verbal tics in the text. The program asks the user what tics to look for. A user can enter multiple tics, separated by commas - any spaces entered by the user before or after each tic will be ignored.

The program will output:

- the total number of tics found in the text
- the density of tics (proportion of all words in the text that are tics)
- the frequency of each of the verbal tics
- the percentage that each tic represents out of all the total number of tics
